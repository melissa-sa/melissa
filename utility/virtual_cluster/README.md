## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
We show here how to setup a virtual cluster on your local machine, and how to run
the Melissa heat example on it. The  virtual cluster enables you to run various nodes, through Docker containers,
managed by the [OAR batch scheduler](http://oar.imag.fr)  on  your local machine.

This is a very handy intermediate step to validate your developments without having the burden to
confront directly with the supercomputer environment.


This directory contains the necessary files and scripts to install and run a virtual cluster with 2 batch schedulers: OAR and Slurm.
We consider that you cloned the sources of Melissa in <Your_Melissa_Folder>.

We modified the original [OAR-docker](https://oar.imag.fr/wiki:oar-docker) to:

* installing melissa dependencies
* installing and enabling slurm




## Docker Installation <a name="docker"></a>

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

Add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

logout/login for  the changes to be activated.

To check the groups your user id is associated to:

```bash
id
```

## Virtual Cluster Installation <a name="cluster"></a>

You don't need to install Melissa first. All the next steps can be done in the sources.

For installing and starting the virtual cluster rely on the script:

```bash
oardocker.sh
```

If you only want to install the virtual cluster (without starting it):
```bash
oardocker.sh install
```

If you already installed the virtual cluster, start it with:
```bash
oardocker.sh start
```

This virtual cluster will have:
* 3 compute nodes: node1, node2, node3
* 1 server
* 1 frontend
where the frontend and nodes share the `/home` directory.
By default, the directory containing Melissa sources will be shared with the virtual cluster.


For connecting to a  cluster node
```bash
oardocker connect frontend
```
To exec command on the frontend for instance:
```bash
oardocker exec frontend ls -al
```
To stop the cluster
```bash
oardocker stop
```

To stop the containers:
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```
To delete the running containers and the images

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

To copy a file to a docker container (use `docker ps` to retreive the container hash):
```bash
docker cp  slurm.conf 72ca2488b353:/etc/slurm-llnl/slurm.conf
```

## Installing Melissa <a name="melissa"></a>

Start a virtual cluster:
```bash
oardocker.sh start
```

Connect to the frontend:
```bash
oardocker connect frontend
```

You are now on the cluster frontend. Melissa folder was shared with the virtual cluster, you should find it in

```bash
/home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/melissa
```

You can also just clone it from the repo (in <Your_Melissa_Folder> dir not to loss it once you reboot the cluster):
```bash
cd <Your_Melissa_Folder>
git clone https://github.com/melissa-sa/melissa.git
```

### Compile Melissa

Go to <Your_Melissa_Folder> directory and recompile in specific build and install directories, to avoid  mixing  it with your local host install:

```bash
cd ~/<Your_Melissa_Folder>
mkdir build-oardocker
cd build-oardocker
cmake ../. -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=OFF -DINSTALL_ZMQ=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker
make install
source ../install-oardocker/bin/melissa_set_env.sh
```

### Compile the Study

Compile the heat example solver:

```bash
cd /home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker/share/melissa/examples/heat_example/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../solver
make
make install
cd ..
```




## Running the Heat Example  with OAR <a name="heatoar"></a>

Go to the installed heat example directory in the OAR specific directory:

```bash
cd /home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker/share/melissa/examples/heat_example/study_OAR
```
and run:

```bash
melissa_launcher -o options.py &
```

To monitor job execution:

```bash
oarstat
```

At the end of the study, the results are in

```
/home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker/share/melissa/examples/heat_example/OAR/STATS
```

### OAR Monitoring tools

You can see the status of your virtual cluster in your favorite web browser using the Monica web service:

```
http://localhost:40080/monika/
```
And the Gantt chart of the jobs using the Drawgantt tool:
```
http://localhost:40080/drawgantt-svg/
```


## Running the Heat Example  with SLURM <a name="heatslurm"></a>

Go to the installed heat example directory in the SLURM specific directory:

```bash
cd /home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker/share/melissa/examples/heat_example/study_Slurm
```
and run:

```bash
melissa_launcher -o options.py &
```
To monitor job execution:

```bash
sinfo -i 5
```

At the end of the study, the results are in

```
/home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker/share/melissa/examples/heat_example/Slurm/STATS
```


## Running the Heat Example on cluster <a name="heatcluster"></a>

Go to the study_cluster directory in heat example:

```bash
cd /home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker/share/melissa/examples/heat_example/study_cluster
```
and run:

```bash
melissa_launcher -o options.py &
```
To monitor job execution:

```bash
sinfo -i 5
```

At the end of the study, the results are in

```
/home/docker/<Your_Melissa_Folder>/install-oardocker/share/melissa/examples/heat_example/study_cluster/STATS
```


## Pitfalls

* Some networks block public DNS servers to encourage people to use network's own DNS server. Docker containers default to Google's 8.8.8.8 public DNS server. [This solution](https://development.robinwinslow.uk/2016/06/23/fix-docker-networking-dns/) can fix the problem of containers not updating and installing dependencies.
